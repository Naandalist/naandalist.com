At AIA Singapore, a leading insurer, I contributed by upgrading the React Native project from v0.65 to the latest stable release, delivering new features, and proactively addressing security vulnerabilities through Snyk monitoring and audit compliance. I also performed root-cause analysis and issue resolution with Jira documentation.
