At AIA Singapore, a leading insurer, I worked on React Native apps used internally by business and operations teams.

- Upgraded React Native project from v0.65 to the latest stable release for long-term maintainability.
- Monitored and fixed security vulnerabilities identified by Snyk, reducing critical findings.
- Performed root-cause analysis for production issues, documented them in Jira, and implemented fixes that reduced repeat incidents over time.
