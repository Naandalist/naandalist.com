At [AIA Singapore](https://www.aia.com.sg/en/index), a leading insurer, I worked on [eBenefits](https://apps.apple.com/id/app/aia-ebenefits-app/id1523776118?l=id) customer mobile app built with React Native and on Elevate, an internal web app for operations teams.

<ul style="margin-left: -1.25rem; padding-left: 1.25rem;">
  <li>Upgraded <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a> project from v0.65 to the latest stable release for long-term maintainability.</li>
  <li>Monitored and fixed security vulnerabilities identified by <a href="https://snyk.io/">Snyk</a>, reducing critical findings.</li>
  <li>Performed root-cause analysis for production issues, documented them in <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/">Confluence</a>, and implemented fixes that reduced repeat incidents over time.</li>
</ul>
