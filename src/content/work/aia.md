At [AIA Singapore](https://www.aia.com.sg/en/index), a leading insurer, I worked on [eBenefits](https://apps.apple.com/id/app/aia-ebenefits-app/id1523776118?l=id) customer mobile app built with React Native and on Elevate, an internal web app for operations teams.

- Upgraded [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) project from v0.65 to the latest stable release for long-term maintainability.
- Monitored and fixed security vulnerabilities identified by [Snyk](https://snyk.io/), reducing critical findings.
- Performed root-cause analysis for production issues, documented them in [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/), and implemented fixes that reduced repeat incidents over time.
