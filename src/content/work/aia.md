At AIA Singapore, a leading insurer, I worked on eBenefits customer mobile app built with React Native and on Elevate, an internal web app for operations teams.

- Upgraded React Native project from v0.65 to the latest stable release for long-term maintainability.
- Monitored and fixed security vulnerabilities identified by Snyk, reducing critical findings.
- Performed root-cause analysis for production issues, documented them in Confluence, and implemented fixes that reduced repeat incidents over time.
