At Airpaz, I build and maintain features for Android and iOS apps used by travelers across Southeast Asia using React Native and TypeScript.

- Implemented progressive JSON loading in key booking flows to reduce perceived load time on slower networks.
- Set up end-to-end tests and reusable mocks for critical flight booking flows.
- Built a Slack notification bot integrated with the CI/CD pipeline to announce app release status to the team.
- Improved app stability by tracking and fixing production issues reported in Sentry.
