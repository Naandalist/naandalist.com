At [Airpaz](https://www.airpaz.com/en), I build and maintain features for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atnetwork.airpazdev&hl=id) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/id/app/airpaz-pesawat-hotel/id1066890405?l=id) apps used by travelers across Southeast Asia using React Native and TypeScript.

- Implemented progressive JSON loading in key booking flows to reduce perceived load time on slower networks.
- Set up [maestro end-to-end](https://maestro.dev/) tests and reusable mocks for critical flight booking flows.
- Built a [Slack notification bot](https://docs.slack.dev/messaging/sending-messages-using-incoming-webhooks/) integrated with the CI/CD pipeline to announce app release status to the team.
- Improved app stability by tracking and fixing production issues reported in [Sentry](https://docs.sentry.io/).
