## Overview

[Kamus KBBI VI](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.naandalist.kamus_kbbi) is a digital Indonesian dictionary mobile application based on the official Big Indonesian Dictionary (Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia) VI Edition. It provides instant access to comprehensive word definitions and phrases in Indonesian language, serving over 10,000 users on the Google Play Store.

## Why Did I Build This?

**The Problem:**
Indonesian students, writers, and language learners often struggle with accessing reliable Indonesian language references on-the-go. Traditional dictionary books are bulky and inconvenient, while existing digital solutions were either incomplete, cluttered with ads, or compromised user privacy.

**The Solution:**
I developed Kamus KBBI VI to provide a clean, fast, and privacy-focused mobile dictionary that puts the entire KBBI VI Edition in users' pockets. The goal was to make Indonesian language learning accessible, convenient, and trustworthy for everyone.

- **Professional Writers** - Content creators, journalists, and authors who require precise Indonesian word usage and definitions
- **Language Learners** - Both native speakers improving their vocabulary and foreigners learning Indonesian
- **Educators** - Teachers using it as a teaching aid in Indonesian language classes

## When Was It Launched?

The app was initially launched on December 11, 2022, and has been actively maintained since then with regular updates based on user feedback. The most recent update was released on November 9, 2025.
